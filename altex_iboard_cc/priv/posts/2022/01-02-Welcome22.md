## Welcome in the year 2022!

Just the perfect time to start a new round of my blog.

This time, I'm using Elixir and Phoenix. And as before with PHP, Ruby, Java, and 
what not, this blog exists only as a playground for my developments. 

Don't expect any continuous thread or topic. Mostly I'll post here because
I want test a new feature -- not because I wanna say something _;-)_

Nevertheless, you may find some useful hints, code fragments, and the one or the 
other “wise advise.”

Have fun browsing altex.iboard.cc!

You can find the code for this web site at [Github](https://github.com/iboard/altex).
