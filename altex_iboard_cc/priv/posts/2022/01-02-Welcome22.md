## Welcome in the year 2022! 

Just the perfect time to start a new round of my blog.

This time, I'm using Elixir and Phoenix. And as before with PHP, Ruby, Java, and 
what not, this blog exists only as a playground for my developments. 

Don't expect any continuous thread or topic. Mostly I'll post here because
I have to test some new feature -- not because I've something to say.

Nevertheless, you may find some useful hints, code fragments, and the one or
other "wise advise."

Have fun browsing altex.iboard.cc!
