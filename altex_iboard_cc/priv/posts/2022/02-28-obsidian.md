Today, I learned about [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and I'm excited about.

Over the last decades I tried a lot of note taking approaches. I liked them more 
less. Some I used for years, others failed after some months.
And guess what, between switching these tools, I always came back to plain paper. Though
the plain paper mutated to e-paper meanwhile.

**Obsidian** stands out at the first day of using it. Better to say, setting up my first
idea of structured knowledge. My personal, structured knowledge.

First of all it is an eye-catcher for me, every time I see some concept is using the 
most simple data-format. And in case of notes this obviously is text and [[Markdown]].

There is a well structured [web site](https://obsidian.md) to find out more about Obsidian.
After one day of fiddling around with it and build some notes and links to begin with,
I'm really looking forward using it for at least the next weeks.

A more detailed report will follow. Also, there are a lot of channels out there to dive
into, just in case you'll give it a try ;-)
