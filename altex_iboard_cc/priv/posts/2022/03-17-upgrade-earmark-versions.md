Lately, I had troubles updating this "[nimble-publisher-based][]" website. But thanks to the
continues work of the community, everything works just fine again with the latest versions.


```elixir
    {:earmark, "~> 1.4"},
    {:earmark_parser, "~> 1.4.22"},
    {:nimble_publisher, "~> 0.1"},
    {:makeup_elixir, ">= 0.0.0"},
    {:makeup_erlang, ">= 0.0.0"},
```
