After decades using Macs only, I'm back to Linux. My last macBook pro has a broken keyboard (yes, butterfly :-/) and after only thre years the battery starts to get thicker. Shame on you Apple!

So, I tried a really cheep AMD-powered PC with Linux and i3 tiling window manager. And, after one week, I don't miss my OSX.

Are you a switcher in that direction? Leave a comment below.
