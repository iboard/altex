The last couple of weeks I ran ArchLinux and did a lot of "playing around with stuff". Now, I finally decide, I will use ArchLinux for my daily workstation.

I did all of my investigations on a cheep AMD-PC. But now, as I know what I really want to be my workstation looks like, I installed ArchoLinuxD with i3wm on an 10 years old MacBookPro. The old MacBook doesn't work with current OS X anyways. But look what Linux can do with a 10 years old hardware. Coooool!

More to come....
