I have four little hex-packages out there at [hexdocs.pm](https://hex.pm/users/iboard)

  - [Bucketier](https://hexdocs.pm/bucketier), a simple key/value store.
  - [Timewrap](https://hexdocs.pm/timewrap), a time-wrapper which can freeze/unfreeze time.
  - [DataSource](https://hexdocs.pm/data_source), a GenStage implementation of data sources.
  - [Exconfig](https://hexdocs.pm/exconfig), **obsolete** a GenServer implementation to cache configuration from `Application` and `System`

Find examples of the four packages at [Github](https://github.com/iboard/hexpack-examples/blob/master/test/hexpack_examples_test.exs). 

If you want to use any of my packages, have a look at those tests and you see 
how to use them.

Use the tag [hex](/category/hex/index.html) to see all postings about the hex-packages.
