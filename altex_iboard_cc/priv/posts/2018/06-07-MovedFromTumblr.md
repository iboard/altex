# Goodbye Tumblr?

Today I successfully imported my Tumblr-blog,
which is on air since 2011, into a local
Jekyll-page.

## May be

My blog will officially move to my E2C instance soon.


# Testing

Let's test some behaviour. Unfortunatelly, imported posts
doesn't support code-highlighting. Will new posts?

```elixir
defmodule TestHighlighter do
  def hello do
    IO.puts "Hello, World!"
  end
end
```
