My blog moved from _Tumblr_ to _Jekyll_ running on an _EC2-instance_.

To be honest, I'm quite happy with _Tumblr_ and I drive my blog there for
several years now. That's the only reason; it is time for a change. And
because I'm even happier when using _Jekyll_ for our company's projects,
I thought I should move my blog as well.

### And here it is

... running in Docker-container on an AWS EC2 instance. The setup and 
first deploy was a matter of minutes.

The original Tumblr-blog is still online at https://blog.iboard.cc

Just the right work for a lazy afternoon at The Programming Kitchen
