<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let&#39;s just skip all the frameworks entirely. Learn how to do the work. Learn how to apply inspect and adapt to the work itself. Learn everything (all frameworks + underlying thinking). Build your own process. Nobody excels by following a rigid set of rules by rote.</p>&mdash; Allen Holub (@allenholub) <a href="https://twitter.com/allenholub/status/1014537853794045952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, "2018"</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
