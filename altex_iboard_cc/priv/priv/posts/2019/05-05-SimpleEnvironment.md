I'm a Un‚ú™x shell and Vi[m] user since 1986 and after years, my environment
settings become messy. I never have to clean up because I was the only one
using it. ... and it was so convenient.

But now, I'm about to persuade my colleague to use _vim_ for better pair 
programming. We started with a newly created user on a _macMini_ running
OS X. 

Quickly, it turns out that my beloved environment becomes a hurdle. Everything
I want to show to my colleague doesn't work (out of the box) on his machine.
This was so annoying that I came to a hard, but I think healthful, decision. 

*I start my environment from scratch*

  1. returned to _bash_ from _fish_.
  1. empty `.bashrc`, `.profile`, and `.vimrc`.
  1. added the most needed configurations ans vim-plug ins only.
  1. made _Gists_ for the files.

Compared to my grown environment settings, this seems to be almost empty
and fits in my head again üòÅ.
