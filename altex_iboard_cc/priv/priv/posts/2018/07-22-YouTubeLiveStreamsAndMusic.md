## So annoying...
![Blocked](/assets/posts/2018/XConfYouTube-restrictions.png)

I wouldn't watch the conference's live-stream because of the music in between 
sessions! I do want to see the talks; right?

For this reason, dear live-streamers of conferences, please mute the sound of 
the stream in breaks when you play copyrighted music.

And nowadays, it should be possible for Google to autodetect and auto-mute the 
music instead of blocking the entire video.
